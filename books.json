Anthony was once the embodiment of valor, the defender of all things good, and the go-to guy for vanquishing evil with a smile. But one fateful day, he woke up to a rude surprise – he's no longer the hero he used to be. In fact, he's got a bad case of amnesia and a snazzy new title: Death Knight. Not quite the retirement plan he had in mind! Join Anthony on an uproarious quest to regain his memory, inspire others to be heroes in a world gone bonkers. Sometimes we fumble and sometimes we fall, as long as we keep trying, that’s what can change it all. Will Anthony rise from his undead funk and become the hero he was meant to be, or is he doomed to be the punchline of an otherworldly joke? Find out in this side-splitting, spellbinding comedy fantasy where death isn't the end, but rather, the beginning of a hilariously twisted adventure.",

Yet they have a mandate, free those that are being oppressed. Sarenmenti, Humans, Kuruvians, Chaleelians and the genetic creations of the AI called the Planner, Avarians, band together under the banner of the Free Fleet to go to the fleet’s birthplace-Earth. Life is nothing but a battle for a survival, and Salchar is going to have to use all of his skills to keep his people alive. The galaxy has a few surprises to throw his way, as well as some polticians up to their own games. Salchar is going to wish for battles instead of dealing with the twisted minds of politicians and people that think they are still the centre of the universe.",

Their journey has been filled with laughter, love and loss. With each step they have strived to unite a fractured land. Their old enemy, once concealed in the shadows, is now unmasked and poised to unleash unparalleled devastation upon Dena. Claire, the former High Judge turned disgraced Necromancer, made the ultimate sacrifice, delving into forbidden magic to resurrect her fellow Guardians and her beloved. Together, they stand as the last defenders of a lost generation. The people of Dena, galvanized by the Guardians' unwavering resolve, rally beside them. Bound by a common purpose, they join forces to face the resurfaced threat of the Drafeng with courage and determination. Anthony, armed with the full weight of his memories and the support of his fellow Guardians and familiars, steps into the forefront of the battle. His purpose is clear: to fight today so that tomorrow, the people of Dena can finally smile without the looming specter of war. In this gripping conclusion to the epic saga, bonds are tested, sacrifices made, and heroes emerge from the crucible of conflict. As they stand on the brink of a final, cataclysmic confrontation, they must summon every ounce of strength, wisdom, and unity they possess to secure Dena's future. Lich’s Love is a heart-wrenching and triumphant finale that will leave you breathless, your emotions soaring, as the fate of Dena hangs in the balance for one last, epic battle. What would you do to save the ones you love?",

Sphere World heralded a greater change than the balance of power between the guilds and free player clans. As Luke struggles with his new reality, his changing future. Brad and Stuart must struggle with the new authority and power they wield. They’re not just dealing with corporations and hostile takeovers, the Factions of humanity each want a piece of Sphere World and they’ll do whatever they have to, to do so. Sally, cares nothing for their problems, only caring about her sole mission. Destroy the Adraxi where they are found. The first scout has been spotted, and she knows that means one thing. Their fleets are coming. Build the warships, load the dropships and power up the tanks. The net is going to war.",
